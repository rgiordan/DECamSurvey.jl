Note: allow the PSF dictionary scale to be different from the pixel sampling scale.

David will send locations on NERSC
Image: .ooi-.fits.fz (not exactly sky-subtracted, but "constant sky")
Weight = 1 / sigma^2 -oow-.fits
Mask = ood.fits
(Note "ok?" instead of "oo?" is also ok.)

c4d_yymmdd_uttime.ooi_band_processingverion.fits

Use stuff in the DR3.  The fz compression is for fits only.  It only compresses the data block, leaving the header block readable.

Use "fpack" and "funpack".

Each FITS file has one for each CCD in the image.

GAIA: is combined with PSI (pan stars, you can ask Eddie and Aaron, which had multiple bands).  (GAIA had only one band.)
